# Contributing Guide

Thank you so much for showing an interest in contributing to project_name! I am excited to see what you have to add :)

## 🦀 Rust Toolchain

project_name uses the nightly distribution of the rust toolchain. You can get on the nightly edition of rustfmt, the only toolchain component used by project_name, by running the following command:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```

## 🏗️ Build System

project_name uses [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) for all build scripts. Please run the following command to install cargo-make:

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Once you have cargo-make installed you can run `cargo make TASK_NAME` to run a certain task. All tasks are prefixed with `tasks.` and are stored in the [Makefile.toml](Makefile.toml) file. So if you wanted to build the development binary for example you would run the following command:

```bash
cargo make build-rust-dev
```

## 🧪 Linters

project_name only uses two linters: [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt). hadolint will lint the dockerfiles stored in [docker/](docker/) and rustfmt will lint the source code in [src/](src/). Please install hadolint using your system's package manager and rustfmt with the toolchain command provided in the [🦀 Rust Toolchain section](#-rust-toolchain).

## 🔄 File Syncing

project_name uses a GitHub action called [gh_fsync](https://github.com/Matt-Gleich/gh_fsync) to automatically sync certain files from other repositories. The configuration for gh_fsync is stored in [fsync.yml](fsync.yml). This all means that if you update a file in this repository before removing it from the configuration then gh_fsync will reset it back. If you are looking to change a file for project_name that is listed in the configuration please remove it from the configuration or update the source file.

Thats all, good luck with your contribution, and please make an issue if anything doesn't make sense.
